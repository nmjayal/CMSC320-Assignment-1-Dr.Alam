Q2: What field could data science be applied to? Give and Example and how it

Answer: Data science can be applied to meteorology. Forecasting the weather 
requires meteorologists to look a vast amount data such as climate details, 
cloud patterns, wind speed and directions, and much more to create a prediction.
